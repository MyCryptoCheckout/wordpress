Network content syndication made easy! Automatically share content by multiposting between multisite blogs.

== Description ==

= Network Content Syndication Made Easy! =

Single source content on a Wordpress multisite network is now as easy as pie! Syndicate posts to other blogs in the network, update posts between blogs, sync posts, share content templates, etc. Broadcasted posts can be linked to their parents, which updates child posts when the parent post is updated. This includes all data: title, slug, content, custom fields, attachments, etc.

Broadcast, formerly ThreeWP Broadcast, is great for:

* Chain stores
* Franchises
* News sites
* Schools
* Anything else with distributed content!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need support! =

Broadcast is supported in the forum. For users of the add-on packs, support is available via e-mail.

= Debug dumps =

A debug dump is the long text that is displayed when broadcasting a post with debug mode on. This dump can then be read to see what Broadcast is or isn't doing.

To switch on debug mode, <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/doc/debug-mode/">see the admin settings</a>. If your site is live it would be wise to input your IP in the associated textarea, so that only you see the debug dump.

= Blacklist, whitelisting, force broadcast =

Broadcasting to specific blogs, hiding blogs and forcing blogs can be acheived with the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-blog-settings/">User & Blog Settings add-on</a>.

= Bulk broadcast existing pages =

To broadcast many posts at once, see the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/send-to-many/">Send To Many</a> add-on.

= Galleries and attachments =

How broadcast handles attachments:

1. Attachments directly attached are stored.
1. Attachments found in [gallery] shortcodes are stored.
1. On the child blog, the existing attachments to the post, if any, are automatically deleted to keep attachments clean. This behavior can be configured using custom code or add-ons: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/duplicate-attachments/">Duplicate Attachments</a>, <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/update-attachments/">Update Attachments</a>.
1. The stored attachments are copied.
1. The thumbnail ID is replaced.
1. The image URLs in the post content are replaced.
1. The image IDs in [gallery] shortcodes are replaced.

Do you have a lot of attachments that you don't want duplicated to hundreds of child blogs, in order to save space? You'll have to find a way to refer to the images statically instead of using their media IDs. The reason for this is that when Wordpress is referred to an attachment, it can only read the media IDs from the current blog. It cannot switch blogs in order to load the image.

= Hide broadcast from the users =

The broadcast meta box, menu and columns in the post view can be hidden from users / roles / blogs using the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-blog-settings/">User & Blog Settings add-on</a>.

= Incompatible plugins =

Below is a list of plugins that just will not work properly with Broadcast and / or its addons:

* <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/intuitive-custom-post-order/">Intuitive Custom Post Order</a> - Prevents broadcasting due to switch_to_blog() mismatch.
* Post Type Switcher - Turns post types into attachments and vice versa.
* Taxonomy Terms Order - prevents terms from being seen.

= Orphans? =

If you have already created posts on other blogs that are supposed to be children of a specific post, you can use the "find unlinked" bulk action to find and link them.

If the existing posts are not linked, broadcasting a post can result in duplicates.

To be considered an orphan the orphaned posts must have the exact same title (name) as the soon-to-be parent and be of the same post type.

You can also use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/delete-before-broadcast/">Delete Before Broadcast add-on</a> to delete any similar posts on the child blog before broadcasting.

= Timeout problems =

If you have many attachments in your post, and are broadcasting the post to many blogs, you might encounter a PHP timeout. This means that broadcasting exceeded the PHP time limit and had to be aborted.

There are several solutions to this problem:

1. Increase the PHP timeout in your PHP.ini settings. This will not speed up broadcasting, only increase your chances of completely broadcasting the post.
2. Use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/duplicate-attachments/">Duplicate Attachments add-on</a>. This will duplicate any attachments + thumbnails instead of regenerating them on each child blog.
3. Use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/queue/">Queue add-on</a> to put each child broadcast into a queue that is emptied by javascript.

You will not need solution #1 if you use solutions #2 and #3. :)

= Why can I not see the Broadcast meta box? =

Make sure that:

1. The plugin is network enabled
2. Your user level has broadcast access (Broadcast access role)
3. Your user has write access to more than this blog (see Admin settings > Maintenenace > View blog access). You can also use the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/all-blogs/">All Blogs add-on</a> to give yourself access to all blogs.
4. The correct post type(s) have been selected in the Broadcast settings
5. The <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-blog-settings/">User & Blog Settings add-on</a> is not set to hide the meta box from the user / role / blog

= WooCommerce =

Broadcast is capable of handling simple WooCommerce products.

1. In the Broadcast custom post type settings: Add "product".
2. Save the product normally first.
3. Then broadcast, selecting the custom fields and taxonomies checkboxes.

This will broadcast all normal product settings: SKU, price, etc.

If your products have variations, a product image gallery, you want to sync stock, you want to sync orders, need the attribute taxonomies to be synced, you'll be wanting the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/woocommerce/">WooCommerce add-on</a>.

= 38.4 20170605 =

* Tested with Wordpress v4.8
* Fix: Show "Broadcasted" column on ALL post types that are in the custom post type settings. Action has prio 100, which should ensure the columns are shown even for those badly coded plugins that reset the visible columns.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/ultimate-member/">Ultimate Member</a>: adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/">Ultimate Member</a> plugin.

* New: Added override_child_permalink action, and a <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/snippet/override-child-permalink/">snippet showing how to use the action to selectively override child permalinks</a>.
* Code: Added more debug info during BC, this time about the parent post broadcast data (link data).
* Code: Cut down a little on the attachment debug info.
* Code: Added switch_broadcast_data() method.
* Code: Check for blog existence during each_linked_post.

= 38.3 20170523 =

* Fix: Allow Broadcast to be activated on a single install.
* Fix: Check for plugin existence before trying to extract info for system info tab and debug dumps.

* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/jetpack/">Jetpack</a> adds support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Automattic's Jetpack plugin</a>.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/user-role-sync/">User Role Sync</a> sync user roles between blogs.
* New snippet: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/snippet/do-not-broadcast-a-taxonomy/">Do not broadcast a taxonomy</a> shows how to prevent a taxonomy from being broadcasted.
* New snippet: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/snippet/remove-access-to-a-blog/">Remove access to a blog</a> shows how to remove access for a user to a blog, to prevent the blog from being shown in the broadcast meta box.

= 38.2 20170428 =

* New: Add edit link back to parent post in the broadcast meta box for child posts.
* New: Add edit and view links for the parent post in the child post actions popup in the post overview.
* New: Add edit and view links for the child post actions popup in the post overview.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/page-content-shortcode/">Page Content Shortcode</a> provides a <code>[bc_page_content slug="pageslug"]</code> shortcode to display the contents of a page.
* Code: Rolling back usage of $blog->switch_to and ->switch_from. This is to un-unnecessarily futureproof things.
* Code: Add find_unlinked_posts_blogs action to give developers choice of which blogs to search for unlinked children. Also works with the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/find-some-unlinked-children/">Find Some Unlinked Children add-on</a>. There's also a <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/snippet/find-unlinked-children-only-on-some-blogs/">code snippet</a> showing how to use the action.

= 38 20170406 =

Finally dropped the "ThreeWP" prefix from the plugin name! The code remains the same, though, just the plugin name is changed.

* Fix: Extra check to see whether the attachment was correctly copied. Catches a fatal error when the attachment does not return with a real filename.
* Fix: Some attachments do not have proper filenames (mp3), so avoid clearing the filename completely. Fixes fatal errors when broadcasting those types of files.
* Code: Make _get_post_children function public so that the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/rebroadcast/">Rebroadcast add-on</a> can queue posts.

= 37 20170316 =

* Fix: Try to replace all media thumbnail URLs in the post content, instead of just the full image size. This will fix references to image thumbnails also.
* Fix: Plugin now uses standard Wordpress translation functions so that it can now be translated online. No experience with this, but it looks to make translation really easy.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/all-images/">All Images</a> detects all referenced local images in post text fields and adds them to the broadcast.

The next major version of Broadcast will finally have the "ThreeWP" dropped from the name. The files on disk will still be called the same, and the action names will still have the threewp prefix. Only the visible name in the repo and plugin list will change.

The add-on pack names will also lose their prefixes.

= 36 20170303 =

* Fix: Remove warning when trying to get file sizes of non-local attachments. Of course that will fail.
* Fix: Non-local attachments, when being copied, retain their GUIDs instead of getting a URL based on the child blog. This is useful for retaining CDN urls on attachments.
* Code: Added prepare_custom_fields() to broadcasting_data in order to help obey the custom field lists when broadcasting taxonomies.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/learndash">LearnDash</a>: New add-on. Adds support for the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/">LearnDash LMS</a> plugin.

Translators! The next version of Broadcast will include the new translation __() calls used for translating the plugin online. Please contact me if you know anything about how the Wordpress translation management works, so that we can iron out translation migration kinks before they become a problem.

= 35.9 20170216 =

* New: Also sync / broadcast term taxonomy metadata. This will automatically add support for plugins that store extra data in taxonomy metadata, like venues and organisers in the Calendarize It plugin. Developers can look at the terms_and_taxonomies trait to see how it works.
* Fix: Force setting of exactly the same post dates and modified dates on the children. This fixes the child posts sometimes being a second off. Also allows for "only if child modified" functionality in the <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/protect-child-properties/">Protect Child Properties add-on</a>.
* Fix: Do not allow broadcasting to the parent blog. This is something that was possible to do via the API.
* SDK update. Removed PHPmailer class.

= 35.8 20170203 =

* Fix: Make the unchecked post actions in the meta box work again. A previous change in 35.5 broke the delete/trash option from the select box that appears when a broadcasted post is unchecked in the meta box.

= 35.7 20170127 =

* New: Add special check for incompatible plugins (only Post Type Switcher so far) and show an error message instead of broadcasting.
* Fix: Check that the child blog exists before broadcasting to it. Fixes maintenance checks failing when blogs have been deleted.
* Fix: Do extra image URL replacements in the content for all copied attachments. Requires that the images have been copied during the broadcast (attaching the image to the blog, or referring to the image in a gallery will suffice). This will take care of images that are statically referenced within shortcodes.

= 35.5 20170113 =

* Fix: If using a bulk action on a post that is not broadcasted, do not trash / delete it.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/ninja-forms/">Ninja Forms</a> adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/">Ninja Forms</a> plugin.

= 35.3 20170106 =

* Fix: Debug file URL.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/aqua-page-builder/">Aqua Page Builder</a> adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/aqua-page-builder/">Aqua Page Builder plugin</a>.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/shortcode-terms/">Shortcode Terms</a>. Automatically translates taxonomy term IDs found in shortcodes when broadcasting.
* Code: Show Wordpress version in system info / debug.

= 35.1 20161206 =

* Fix: Extra check that attachments exist, for those times when posts are attached but don't have files.
* Fix: Ignore post type hierarchical support when checking for broadcasted parents. This fixes the fatal error when broadcasting WooCommerce Variations that, for some reason, do not support hierarchies, but still have parent posts.

= 35 20161206 =

* Fix: Do not clear the attachment_data array in the broadcasting data. Fixes WooCommerce Swatches being ignored if there are normal attachments.
* Code: More robust way of retrieving equivalent_posts. This fixes a bug when broadcasting ACF relations between two blogs with the same child posts as relations, instead of broadcasting a related post from the parent blog to a child.
* Code: Warn network admins of incompatible Broadcast and BC add-on pack versions. Users should keep the MAJOR versions of both the same.
* Code: Added support for partial broadcasts. This is used with the Queue add-on when broadcasting products with _many_ variations which normally would timeout even the most patient of servers. See broadcasting_data->partial_broadcast().

= 34.5 20161111 =

* Code: More upload_dir debugging info.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/divi-builder/">Divi Builder</a>. Adds support for <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/plugins/divi-builder/">Divi Builder</a> and themes using it. No more getting the logo on your child sites overwritten when broadcasting!

= 34.3 20161027 =

* Code: Reload child custom fields in $bcd->custom_fields()->child_fields() object upon each request.
* Code: Add plugin paths to system info.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/beaver-builder/">Beaver Builder</a>. Adds support for the <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/">Beaver Builder page builder plugin</a>.

= 34.2 20161006 =

* Code: Handle attachments (delete, copy) before taxonomies. This prevents attachment delete+copy+delete+copy sequences when some add-ons (ACF, WooCommerce) request taxonomy attachments be copied.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/local-files/">Local Files</a>. Automatically copies local files to each blog and updates the links in the content.

= 34 20160925 =

* Fix: Prevent duplicate attachments by forcing renaming of copied attachments. This fixes the long-standing problem of attachments with numbers at the end of the filenames being duplicated.

This stems from a Wordpress feature / bug that removes the numbers when copying the images to each child blog. For some reason attachments inserted by PHP code, using normal Wordpress functions, are not assigned the same post_names as on the parent blog, which prevents Broadcast from finding the attachments when updating the post. This will cause Broadcast to recopy the attachment, creating a dupe.

* Code: Added broadcasting_data->copied_attachments_to_blog code, together with ThreeWP_Broadcast->copy_attachments_to_blog().
* The "ThreeWP" part of the plugin name will be dropped in the future.

= 33.1 20160913 =

Minor release. Upgrade not mandatory.

* Code: Initialize broadcasting_data->attachment_data array in the class.
* Code: Display even more debug info when updating / inserting the child post.
= 33 20160817 =

* Fix: Find Unlinked Children finds children with the same status. So a draft will find unlinked drafts. To find different child statuses, just change the status of the parent post before finding.
* Fix: Stricter handling of attachment paths. This fixes Amazon S3 file paths being incorrectly detected as local files by PHP.
* Code: Added collect_post_type_taxonomies action to help plugins sync extra taxonomy data, like ACF images and what not.
* Code: save_post() method returns the broadcasting_data object if anything was broadcasted.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/contact-form-7/">Contact Form 7</a>. Adds support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/">Takayuki Miyoshi's Contact Form 7</a> plugin.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/yoast-seo/">Yoast SEO</a>. Adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast SEO</a> plugin. Only needed if you want taxonomy SEO data synced when broadcasting.
* 4.6.0 compatibility.

= 32.3 20160722 =

* Fix: Check for existence of get_plugin_data() function before broadcasting. Fixes HTTP processing with Queue add-on. Quite an unexpected and illogical bug.

= 32.2 20160719 =

* Fix: A workaround for an existing Yoast SEO workaround. Fixing the first Yoast problem prevented Woocommerce variations from being broadcasted properly. Applies only to users of Yoast + Woocommerce variations.

= 32.1 20160718 =

* Code: raw_html_section. Allow lazy conversion of meta box inputs. Fixed compatibility with v32 of Per Blog Taxonomies.

= 32 20160715 =

* Code: Added broadcasting_data->high_priority property to prevent certain plugins, like the Queue, from broadcasting posts in several steps. All API broadcasts are now set to high_priority.
* New add-on: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/toolset/">Toolset</a> merged the old Types and Views add-ons with new support for CRED post and user forms.

= 31 20160705 =

* Fix: Yet another workaround for Yoast SEO, version 3.3.2 this time.
* New add-on: Calendarize It adds support for <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/calendarize-it-for-wordpress/2568439">Calendarize It!</a> events.
* New add-on: Events Manager adds support for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/">Events Manager</a> plugin.
* Code: post_action action will now affect child posts also. See traits/post_actions. This is for unlinking The Events Calendar recurring events.

= 30 20160606 =

* Debug: Even more debugging info in the debug dumps.
* Code: New preparse_content action which allows plugins that support the action to prepare themselves for modifying post content in different places, not only in the post content.
* Code: broadcast_data->get_linked_post_on_this_blog() checks for both a parent or a child post on this blog and returns the ID.
* Code: Added threewp_broadcast_allowed_post_statuses filter.
* New: Plugin Pack Plugin: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/tao-schedule-update/">Tao Schedule Update</a> adds support for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tao-schedule-update/">Tao Schedule Update</a> plugin.

* Fix: Allow add-on packs to update on servers with weird SSL libraries, using the BROADCAST_PP_SSL_WORKAROUND define.
* Fix: Allow broadcasted drafts to be rescheduled / continue to be scheduled.
* Code: During broadcasting, fetch the new post after updating it.

= 29 20160405 =

* New: Plugin Pack Plugin: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/hreflang/">Hreflang</a> adds support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hreflang">SEO-friendly hreflang html tags</a>.
* New: View Post Info maintenance check. Helps debugging by showing all information about posts and the associated postmeta.

* New: Time savings tab. Keep track of how much time and money you've saved by using Broadcast.
* New Add-on pack plugin: <a href="https://broadcast.plainviewplugins.com/addon/thumbnail-sizes/">Thumbnail Sizes</a> allows for different additional thumbnail sizes on a per-blog basis.

= 25 20151024 =

* Fix: Prevent duplicates when referring to parent posts on the child blog. See https://wordpress.org/support/topic/acf-clone-post-issue?replies=3

= 22 20150721 =

* UI: Admin settings are now the Broadcast menu item itself.
* UI: Settings are now displayed in different tabs. Custom post settings are now part of normal settings.
* UI: Broadcast menu item is not shown at all to users who may not use broadcast.
* UI: Link checkbox is now always checked per default. If checked, it only has an effect if blogs are selected, else it just remains checked without interfering with anything.
* Code: Merge magnific popup js and css into main files.
* Code: Popup uses jQuery objects for the title and the content ($popup.$title and $popup.$content). set_html is renamed to set_content. You can now append jQuery objects directly to the content. Premium pack javascript updated to use same.

* Code: New attachment_data/copied_attachments helper.
* Code: broadcasting_data->broadcast_to() can now take a simple blog ID integer.
* Code: broadcasting_data handles more setup itself, instead of relying on others.
* Code: broadcasting_data now defaults to true for custom fields, linking and taxonomies.

= 20 20150609 =
* New: Custom field handling has been simplified. The "broadcast internal field" setting has been removed and the blacklist, whitelist and protect list now apply to all fields.

The custom field settings can now handle wildcards.

If you do not wish the internal custom fields (the ones that start with an underscore) to be broadcasted, check that you now have _* in the blacklist.

Custom fields are now handled in this order: first check the blacklist, if blacklisted checked the whitelist.

The protect list is applied to the surviving custom fields specified to be protected.

* Fix: Reload broadcast data upon switching blogs during broadcasting. This is probably the cause of half-linked children when broadcasting is interrupted or queued.
* Fix: Posts can have several thousand child posts now. The database column was set too small (text instead of longtext) to allow for all too many child links.
* Code: More debug info. Custom field lists are dumped.
* Code: Fix saving of broadcast data so that it can be resaved during the same broadcast.
* Code: Debug dump now shows HTML tags.
* Updated .pot file for translations.

= 19.1 20150524 =
