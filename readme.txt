- More coming soon!

= Cryptocurrency Donations Widget =

Receive donations in any of the cryptocurrencies supported by MyCryptoCheckout. Generate a widget using our simple shortcode generator and add it into any text widget or text editor. Shortcode generation options:

- select primary currency
- show currencies with icons or a dropdown box
- show QR code
- show wallet address text

= Code snippets =

We have various code snippets that allow you to customize MyCryptoCheckout together with your e-commerce solution:

<a href="https://mycryptocheckout.com/doc/snippets/">See all available code snippets</a>

= Security =

Disable the MCC currencies tab: after you have wallets setup you can prevent them from being edited in the WordPress admin. Add the following code to your wp-config file-

<code>define( 'MYCRYPTOCHECKOUT_DISABLE_WALLET_EDITOR', true );</code>

= Technical disclosure =

Upon plugin activation an account is created on the MyCryptoCheckout API server: api.mycryptocheckout.com. The only data that is sent is your WordPress install's public URL and the plugin version. The URL is used by the API server to know where to send updated account info (license status, payment statistics), exchange rates, and completed purchase notifications. The plugin version is used to help answer requests made by the plugin (different plugin versions speak to the API server differently).

If your server cannot be reached by the API server this plugin will not function.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin
2. Visit Admin > Settings > MyCryptoCheckout
3. Check that your account looks ok
4. Visit the currencies tab
5. Set up one or more currencies
6. Visit your WooCommerce payment gateway settings. The instructions included in receipt e-mails are taken from the WC MCC gateway instructions text boxes.
7. Or visit your EasyDigitalDownloads payment gateway settings. The instructions included in receipt e-mails can be included using the {mcc_instructions} e-mail tag. The text is taken from the EDD MCC payment gateway instructions text boxes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Unable to retrieve your account data =

If MyCryptoCheckout is unable to retrieve the account data for your domain, it's usually due to the MCC API server being blocked from connecting to your install. Check for:

- Coming soon mode / plugins
- Maintenance mode / plugins
- Password protection mode / plugins
- Private site mode / plugins
- Firewalls

If after disabling the above plugins you still can't get it working, then contact us and we'll try to find the cause of the problem.
